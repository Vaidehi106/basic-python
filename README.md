# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
1.  **Input:**
    * The script prompts the user to enter the first number using `input("enter first number: ")`.
    * The script then prompts the user to enter the second number using `input("enter second number: ")`.
    * The `int()` function is used to convert the user's input (which is initially a string) into integer values.

2.  **Calculations:**
    * **Addition:** `add = var1 + var2` calculates the sum of `var1` and `var2`, storing the result in the `add` variable.
    * **Subtraction:** `sub = var1 - var2` calculates the difference between `var1` and `var2`, storing the result in the `sub` variable.
    * **Multiplication:** `mul = var1 * var2` calculates the product of `var1` and `var2`, storing the result in the `mul` variable.
    * **Division:** `div = var1 / var2` calculates the quotient of `var1` divided by `var2`, storing the result in the `div` variable.

3.  **Output:**
    * The script displays the results of each operation using the `print()` function.
    * Each `print()` statement includes a descriptive label (e.g., "Addition: ") followed by the calculated result.

      
# Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
1.  **Input:**
    * The script asks the user to input their first name using the `input()` function.
    * The script then asks the user to input their last name using the `input()` function.
2.  **Greeting:**
    * The script constructs a greeting message using an f-string (formatted string literal).
    * The f-string allows embedding variables directly within the string using curly braces `{}`.
    * The greeting message includes "hello," followed by the user's first and last names, and a welcome message.
3.  **Output:**
    * The constructed greeting message is printed to the console using the `print()` function.
